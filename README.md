# **MACA**: **Ma**sk and **Ca**ption what you see  (UoB Summer Project)

This is 2 implementations of MACA on python3, keras and tensorflow2. The model generates pixel-level masks for each instance of an object in the image and bounding-box-level captions for each area with meaningful contents. It is based on Mask R-CNN and DenseCap.
